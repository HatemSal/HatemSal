# [cite_start]Hi there, I'm Hatem Salem [cite: 4]

[cite_start]I'm an AI Engineer [cite: 9] [cite_start]and a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence student at Cairo University, where I'm ranked first in the AI Department[cite: 24, 25].

[cite_start]My passion lies in building clean, scalable AI solutions[cite: 9]. I have hands-on experience in:
* [cite_start]Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)[cite: 9, 57].
* [cite_start]Designing and building RAG pipelines and AI Agents[cite: 9, 57].
* [cite_start]Fine-tuning Computer Vision architectures for object detection and classification[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]Implementing Classical Machine Learning techniques for data-driven applications[cite: 9, 57].

## What I Work With

Here are some of the primary tools and technologies I use to build projects:

* [cite_start]**Machine Learning / Deep Learning:** Pytorch, Langchain, HuggingFace's Transformers, Sci-kit Learn, Langgraph [cite: 38, 59]
* [cite_start]**AI Deployment / Frameworks:** FastAPI, VLLM, Ollama, Streamlit [cite: 38, 54, 59]
* [cite_start]**Databases / Vector Stores:** MS SQL Server, SQLite, ChromaDB [cite: 38, 60]
* [cite_start]**Cloud:** AWS Cloud Architecture [cite: 62]

## Recent Projects

Here are a few of the projects I've been working on recently.

### [cite_start]Obsidian Notes Agent [cite: 31]
* [cite_start]A RAG-based application designed to turn a personal Obsidian Vault of markdown notes into an interactive assistant you can chat with[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]It features a Q&A retrieval pipeline and a ReAct Agent architecture for summarization tasks[cite: 36, 37].
* [cite_start]Built using Langchain, Langgraph, FastAPI for the backend, and ChromaDB for vector storage[cite: 38].
* [cite_start]**[Link to Repository]** ### GPT2 Building and Finetuning [cite: 39]
* [cite_start]A from-scratch implementation of the GPT-2 architecture, including the core Attention Mechanism, using only simple Pytorch layers[cite: 41, 43].
* [cite_start]After building the architecture, I loaded the official pre-trained weights [cite: 44] [cite_start]and fine-tuned the model on an email spam classification task[cite: 41, 45].
* [cite_start]Tracked experiments and different fine-tuning strategies (like unfreezing only the last layer vs. the last transformer block) using Weights & Biases[cite: 46, 47].
* [cite_start]**[Link to Repository]** ### Voice Gender Classification App [cite: 48]
* [cite_start]A web application that predicts a speaker's gender (Male/Female) from a voice recording[cite: 49].
* [cite_start]The system analyzes key acoustic features from the audio [cite: 52] [cite_start]and uses a Naive Bayes classifier [cite: 49] for the prediction.
* [cite_start]Includes a simple frontend built with Streamlit[cite: 54].
