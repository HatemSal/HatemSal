# Hi, I'm Hatem Salem

I'm an **AI Engineer** passionate about building intelligent systems that combine language, vision, and reasoning. My work spans from **fine-tuning LLMs** and **building AI agents** to **computer vision** and **classical ML** applications — all with a focus on clean, scalable, and practical solutions.

Currently, I’m studying **Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Cairo University**, where I rank **1st in the AI Department (GPA 3.87)**.
